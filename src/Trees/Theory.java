         1 . FULL BINARY TREE --> each node must have 0 or 2 children
         2 . COMPLETE BINARY TREE--> All levels Must be Completely filled ,Except last level nodes as left as possible
         3.  PERFECT  BINARY TREE --> All leaf Nodes must be at the Same Level
         4 .BALANCED BINARY TREE --->  ht of tree must be log(n)
         5 . skewed/de-generated --> ht is n each node has a single children like linkedlist
